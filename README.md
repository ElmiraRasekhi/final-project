There are three Python files in the repository
The main.py file asks you for the dose of estradiol and its repetition period, then it shows the graph of calcium changes and also its spectrogram.
In the healthy.py file, you can see the calcium diagram and histogram in healthy cells
In the 1cycleAD.py file, you can see adding only one dose. And if you choose this number equal to zero, you will see the calcium diagram of cells involved in Alzheimer's disease
